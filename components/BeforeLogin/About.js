          Our mission at GSA is to support each other as 
          we work towards academic and professional success.
          We know that a college education is not just about obtaining a 
          diploma and hanging it on the wall. 
          College is the place for defining one’s self, reaching out and networking 
          with other intelligent and passionate people, and making the 
          best use of resources and opportunities to achieve one’s goals. 
          We do this by advertising the various internships, research, and 
          employment opportunities that come up through CUNY and other sources. 
          Moreover, we go the extra mile to help each other build the skills
          necessary to succeed in classes, applications, and future careers.
